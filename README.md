# CIMPAL-Belgium: Development of a CIMPAL-grid for Belgium

This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis on creating a CIMPAL-grid for Belgium.

## Project Overview
- **Student:** Benoit Ritzen
- **Supervisor:** Teun Everts
- **Research Team:** Prof. Hans Jacquemyn (KU Leuven)
- **Partners:** In collaboration with the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO).
- **Special thanks to:** Tim Adriaens, Diederik Strubbe, and Bram D'hondt for their guidance.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide transparency in the methodology used for the Belgian CIMPAL-grid. By sharing this code, we aim to make the workflow reproducible and applicable to other countries or regions.

## Usage
*Instructions on how to run the scripts will be added as the project progresses.*
